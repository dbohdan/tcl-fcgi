2021-04-23  version 0.5  dbohdan
        remove the C source code (you can get newer) and autoconf; stop
        overriding top-level channel commands; update the examples.


2021-05-01
        go back to overriding top-level channel commands: without [read stdin]
        acting like in a CGI environment [ncgi::query] hangs on a POST
        request; fix the override code with Tom Poindexter's patch from
        comp.lang.tcl; update the examples some more.
