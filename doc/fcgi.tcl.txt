     Fcgi.tcl allows Tcl programs to be used in FastCGI  applica-
     tions.  Fcgi.tcl  requires  Tcl  version 8.0 and higher, and
     Extended Tcl (TclX) version 8.x and higher.

     FastCGI programs are started by an 'AppClass' directive from
     a  web server that supports FastCGI, or are started manually
     and accessed from a web server  via  the  'ExternalAppClass'
     directive.

     Fcgi.tcl comes in two  flavors:  a  100%  Tcl  version,  and
     another  which  is a C extension.  Each fcgi.tcl flavor pro-
     vides the same programming interface.

     When a program using the 100%  Tcl  flavor  of  Fcgi.tcl  is
     started by 'AppClass', Fcgi.tcl assumes that file descriptor
     0 is a socket that is used to accept new connections.   When
     using   'AppClass'   style  connections,  Fcgi.tcl  requires
     Extended Tcl (TclX).

     If 'ExternalAppClass' is used, the FastCGI Tcl program  must
     be  started  manually.   In  this case, Fcgi.tcl expects the
     command line argument ----ppppoooorrrrtttt xxxx or  the  environment  variable
     PPPPOOOORRRRTTTT  to specify the port on which to listen for connection.
     'ExternalAppClass' style connections do not require Extended
     Tcl (TclX).

     Programs using the C  extension  flavor  of  Fcgi.tcl  don't
     require  TclX.  Programs started as 'ExternalAppClass', must
     be started with 'driver.tcl' or similar program.  Driver.tcl
     requires Extended Tcl (TclX).

          Accept a new FastCGI connection.   FCGI_Accept  returns
          "0"  for  a  new  connection,  or  "-1" if an error was
          encountered. If the application was invoked  as  a  CGI
          program, FCGI_Accept will return "0" for the first call

          to it, then return  "-1"  on  subsequent  calls.   This
          allows  a  properly  coded FastCGI program to work in a
          convential CGI environment.  FCGI_Accept sets  environ-
          ment  variables  to that of the initial enviroment plus
          variables for the FastCGI connection.  FCGI_Accept will
          call  FCGI_Finish if a previous response is still pend-
          ing  before  accepting  a  new  request.  Additionally,
          FCGI_Accept  sets the environment variable _F_C_G_I__R_O_L_E to
          one of three values,  depending  of  the  type  of  the
          FastCGI connection:


          RESPONDER
               The FastCGI program receives  CGI/1.1  environment
               variables.   The  FastCGI  program will receive at
               most CCCCOOOONNNNTTTTEEEENNNNTTTT____LLLLEEEENNNNGGGGTTTTHHHH bytes of data on the Tcl chan-
               nel  _s_t_d_i_n. The FastCGI program should respond the
               the request as a typical CGI  program  by  writing
               its output on the Tcl channel _s_t_d_o_u_t.


          AUTHORIZER
               The FastCGI program receives HTTP request informa-
               tion  as  environment variables.  The FastCGI pro-
               gram will receive at most CCCCOOOONNNNTTTTEEEENNNNTTTT____LLLLEEEENNNNGGGGTTTTHHHH bytes  of
               data on the Tcl channel _s_t_d_i_n. The FastCGI program
               should respond as status 200  to  indicate  access
               should  be  granted.  The FastCGI program may also
               send HTTP headers that are prefixed with _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e-
               by writing on _s_t_d_o_u_t.


          FILTER
               The FastCGI program receives  CGI/1.1  environment
               variables.   The  FastCGI  program will receive at
               most CCCCOOOONNNNTTTTEEEENNNNTTTT____LLLLEEEENNNNGGGGTTTTHHHH bytes of data on the Tcl chan-
               nel  _s_t_d_i_n.  After all of stdin has been read, the
               FastCGI program may call  FCGI_StartFilterData  to
               receive  the  additional data stream.  The FastCGI
               program will then receive at most FFFFCCCCGGGGIIII____DDDDAAAATTTTAAAA____LLLLEEEENNNNGGGGTTTTHHHH

          Finish a FastCGI connection by flushing output  buffers
          and  sending  an exit status code.  If an exit code has
          not been set by calling FCGI_SetExitStatus, FCGI_Finish
          assumes a code of "0".

          the  status  code   to   be   returned   upon   calling
          FCGI_Finish.  _s_t_a_t_u_s-_c_o_d_e should be a numeric integer.

          when the FastCGI application's role is FILTER.

          _s_t_d_o_u_t  and  _s_t_d_e_r_r.   The default buffer size for each
          channel is 4096 bytes.  A buffer  size  of  "0"  causes
          output to be flushed on every _p_u_t_s to stdout or stderr.
          The maximum buffer size allowed is 65536 bytes.

          FastCGI output may also be flushed at any time by  cal-
          ling the Tcl command _f_l_u_s_h _s_t_d_o_u_t.

     with the FastCGI developer's kit for Tcl.

     If cgi.tcl is used in the same application as Fcgi.tcl,  you
     should order _p_a_c_k_a_g_e _r_e_q_u_i_r_e commands as:

     package require cgi

     Cgi.tcl uses the global array __c_g_i to  hold  state  informa-
     tion.   FCGI_Accept  will  set  the  __c_g_i array to beginning
     values so that its state information will be reset for  each
     new connection.
